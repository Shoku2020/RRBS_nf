Bismark report for: sample_R1_val_1.fq_trimmed.fq.gz and sample_R2_val_2.fq_trimmed.fq.gz (version: v0.22.3)
Bismark was run with HISAT2 against the bisulfite genome of /Myvolume/fyan0011/GitHub/RRBS_nf/work/fe/b6fcb1f8af147698f6f786b74c1b09/bismarkindex/ with the specified options: -q --score-min L,0,-0.2 --ignore-quals --no-mixed --no-discordant --maxins 500 --no-spliced-alignment --no-softclip --omit-sec-seq
Option '--directional' specified (default mode): alignments to complementary strands (CTOT, CTOB) were ignored (i.e. not performed)

Final Alignment report
======================
Sequence pairs analysed in total:	89790
Number of paired-end alignments with a unique best hit:	39
Mapping efficiency:	0.0% 
Sequence pairs with no alignments under any condition:	89742
Sequence pairs did not map uniquely:	9
Sequence pairs which were discarded because genomic sequence could not be extracted:	0

Number of sequence pairs with unique best (first) alignment came from the bowtie output:
CT/GA/CT:	29	((converted) top strand)
GA/CT/CT:	0	(complementary to (converted) top strand)
GA/CT/GA:	0	(complementary to (converted) bottom strand)
CT/GA/GA:	10	((converted) bottom strand)

Number of alignments to (merely theoretical) complementary strands being rejected in total:	0
