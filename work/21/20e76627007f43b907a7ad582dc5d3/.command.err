 *** Bismark methylation extractor version v0.22.3 ***

Trying to determine the type of mapping from the SAM header line of file sample_R1_val_1.fq_trimmed_bismark_hisat2_pe.bam
Treating file(s) as paired-end data (as extracted from @PG line)

Setting option '--no_overlap' since this is (normally) the right thing to do for paired-end data


Summarising Bismark methylation extractor parameters:
===============================================================
Bismark paired-end SAM format specified (default)
Number of cores to be used: 8
Strand-specific outputs will be skipped. Separate output files for cytosines in CpG, CHG and CHH context will be generated
Merge CHG and CHH context to non-CpG context specified
Output will be written to the current directory ('/Myvolume/fyan0011/GitHub/RRBS_nf/work/21/20e76627007f43b907a7ad582dc5d3')


Summarising bedGraph parameters:
===============================================================
Generating additional output in bedGraph and coverage format
bedGraph format:	<Chromosome> <Start Position> <End Position> <Methylation Percentage>
coverage format:	<Chromosome> <Start Position> <End Position> <Methylation Percentage> <count methylated> <count non-methylated>

Using a cutoff of 1 read(s) to report cytosine positions
Reporting and sorting cytosine methylation information in CpG context only (default)
Sorting chromosomal postions for the bedGraph step using arrays instead of using UNIX sort


Summarising genome-wide cytosine methylation report parameters:
===============================================================
Generating comprehensive genome-wide cytosine report
(output format: <Chromosome> <Position> <Strand> <count methylated> <count non-methylated>  <C-context>  <trinucleotide context> )
Reporting cytosine methylation in CpG context only (default)
Using 1-based genomic coordinates (default)
Genome folder was specified as /Myvolume/fyan0011/GitHub/RRBS_nf/data/
